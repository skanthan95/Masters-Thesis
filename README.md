### Shared Poetic and Narrative Diction in Indo-European Epics: A Computational Analysis

#### Code (thesis.py) can be found above

In this paper, I investigate the possibility of a shared poetic and narrative diction distinct
to epic within battle scenes in the two primary Indo-European epics: the Mahabharata and the
Iliad. I use the Rig Veda and the Hesiodic corpus (the Theogony and the Shield of Heracles) as
control texts, given that they derive from the same culture but belong to different genres. This
investigation will attempt to (a) use quantitative methods to corroborate the longstanding
hypothesis of literary and cultural Indo-European lineage, and (b) explore uncharted territory in
mining structural similarities within large battle books that are difficult to hand-code. I used
noun-adjective pairing frequencies and cosine similarity scores generated through
SentenceBERT models to uncover poetic and narrative similarities in battle terminology shared
between the texts. My overall findings suggest that patterns in poetic diction relating to battle
terminology reveal both a stronger commonality of usage between the Indo-European texts as
compared with the Near-Eastern influenced control corpus, and deeper commonalities between
the two epics poetic diction concerning these battle terms than they share with other texts from
within their separate cultures.
