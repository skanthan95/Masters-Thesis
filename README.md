### Shared Poetic and Narrative Diction in Indo-European Epics: A Computational Analysis

#### Code (thesis.py) can be found above

In this work, I investigate the possibility of a shared poetic and narrative diction distinct
to epic within battle scenes in two primary Indo-European epics. I used
noun-adjective pairing frequencies and cosine similarity scores generated through
SentenceBERT models to uncover poetic and narrative similarities in battle terminology shared
between the texts (as compared to the control texts). My overall findings suggest that patterns in poetic diction relating to battle
terminology reveal both a stronger commonality of usage between the Indo-European texts as
compared with the Near-Eastern influenced control corpus, and deeper commonalities between
the two epics poetic diction concerning these battle terms than they share with other texts from
within their separate cultures.
